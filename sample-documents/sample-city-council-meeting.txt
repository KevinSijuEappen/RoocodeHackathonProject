- 20% local hiring requirement for construction
- LEED Gold certification for all buildings
- Affordable units reserved for households earning 60% AMI or below

PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD:
The public comment period revealed mixed community sentiment:

SUPPORTIVE COMMENTS:
- Sarah Johnson (Resident): "This project addresses our critical housing shortage. We need more affordable options for working families."
- Maria Santos (Housing Advocate): "The 75% affordable housing ratio is exceptional. This will help teachers, firefighters, and service workers live in our community."
- David Chen (Local Business Owner): "The ground floor retail will bring more foot traffic to our struggling downtown area."

CONCERNED COMMENTS:
- Robert Miller (Neighborhood Association): "While we support affordable housing, we're worried about parking spillover into residential streets."
- Lisa Thompson (Resident): "The density seems too high for this area. It will change the character of our neighborhood."
- James Wilson (Traffic Safety Committee): "Main Street is already congested during rush hour. 200 new units will make it worse."

COUNCIL DISCUSSION:
Council Member Rodriguez raised questions about traffic impact studies. The developer presented data showing:
- Peak hour traffic increase: 15% on Main Street
- Mitigation measures: New traffic signal, crosswalk improvements
- Public transit access: Bus stop 200 feet from entrance

Council Member Park emphasized the need for affordable housing, noting:
- Current affordable housing waitlist: 2,400 families

- This project would reduce wait time by 8 months

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Stormwater management system to prevent flooding
- Solar panels on all rooftops
